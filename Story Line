	1) Continue through the minefield	2) Cut left	3) Cut right
1. You perservere through the minefield make it to the end although another one of your men perished due to a mine, Private Wilson has died.
2. You cut left but stumble into an army post, the sniper spots you and sirens go off. You are surrounded and all of your men are shot. YOU DIE.
3. You cut right, this turned out to be a good decision because you find the back of a building blown out and it provides a safe entrance into the city. 

1. (6 poeple left) A sniper outpost lies ahead with 3 units on it, one of them is in the tower with a radio. You have two silenced sniper rifles, grappling hooks and a bazooka, all of which may be used
to help take out the tower, take your pick.

(6 people left)
1.1.One of your snipers hits, the other wounds and the alarm goes off. A dozen trucks with mounted machine guns search the area and find you
... YOU DIE
1.2.Three units are covering while you take 2 with you to grapple onto the snipers nest. All appears well untill one of the enemy hears you and tries cutting 
the lines, he cuts one sucessfully before you shoot him in the face. At this point its a mad rush to the top. Your two snipers on the ground subdue one of them and u leap over the edge 
and eliminate the last soldier who sounded the alarm, reinforcements are inbound.
1.3. You do not want to risk any of your soldiers and decide that a bazooka would be most convininent. You blow up the tower but it now provides a beacon 
for the american soldiers, at least you didn't lose anyone.
1.4. *Phillipes* You think the grappling hook provides too much risk so instead you take off all your equipment aside from 3 perfectly balanced knives and scaleit with gloves to muffle the sound. 
Once you reach the top you eliminate every target without making a sound and make your way back down.

3.1 You command one of your men to prepare explosives, this proves a bad idea when he carelessly drops one and the whole building blows up ... YOU DIE.
3.2 Along the road your men setup for an ambush and you push a broken down car in the middle of the road to obstruct the stransport
3.3 As you allow the truck to pass one of the men on the convoy stops your men hiding and reports it to his officer. The oofficer does nothing so when your 
men and you come out of hiding in a false sense of security the men from the transport truck ambush you... YOU DIE
3.4 You tell your men to hide a few alleys down and you alone, prepare explosives, set them, and then lay low in a broken-down car. As the convoy rolls over you detonate the bomb allong with the truck. You were very successful.
