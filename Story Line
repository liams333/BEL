D.Charles   /  fall off the cliff... YOU DIE.


(answer the call)
P.Norman    \  You are sent on an operation to wreak havoc in the city of Rhode Island. Polar-Force is a death squad.
S.Phillipes  - Outside Rhode island you and your squad of 8 accidentatlly snuck into an old mine field from the battle fought there many years ago,
D.Charles   /  your commanding officer died. You are the new commanding officer
	1) Continue through the minefield	2) Cut left	3) Cut right
1. You perservere through the minefield make it to the end although another one of your men perished due to a mine, Private Wilson has died.
2. You cut left but stumble into an army post, the sniper spots you and sirens go off. You are surrounded and all of your men are shot. YOU DIE.
3. You cut right, this turned out to be a good decision because you find the back of a building blown out and it provides a safe entrance into the city. 

1. (6 poeple left) A sniper outpost lies ahead with 3 units on it, one of them is in the tower with a radio. You have two silenced sniper rifles, grappling hooks and a bazooka, all of which may be used
to help take out the tower, take your pick.
1)Snipe them 2)3 people grapple 3)Use the bazooka 4)*Phillipes* Stealth
2...
3.(7 people left)Your unit has entered into an abandoned meth factory, you salvage dangerous chemicals to make improvised explosives. One of your men has stopped a 
military transport truck coming down the road with an escort.
1)Use explosives 2)Ambush 3)Let them pass 4)*Norman* Firepower

(6 people left)
1.1.One of your snipers hits, the other wounds and the alarm goes off. A dozen trucks with mounted machine guns search the area and find you
... YOU DIE
1.2.Three units are covering while you take 2 with you to grapple onto the snipers nest. All appears well untill one of the enemy hears you and tries cutting 
the lines, he cuts one sucessfully before you shoot him in the face. At this point its a mad rush to the top. Your two snipers on the ground subdue one of them and u leap over the edge 
and eliminate the last soldier who sounded the alarm, reinforcements are inbound.
1.3. You do not want to risk any of your soldiers and decide that a bazooka would be most convininent. You blow up the tower but it now provides a beacon 
for the american soldiers, at least you didn't lose anyone.
1.4. *Phillipes* You think the grappling hook provides too much risk so instead you take off all your equipment aside from 3 perfectly balanced knives and scaleit with gloves to muffle the sound. 
Once you reach the top you eliminate every target without making a sound and make your way back down but you accidentaly trip a wire based alarm.

(7 people left)
3.1 You command one of your men to prepare explosives, this proves a bad idea when he carelessly drops one and the whole building blows up ... YOU DIE.
3.2 Along the road your men setup for an ambush and you push a broken down car in the middle of the road to obstruct the stransport
3.3 As you allow the truck to pass one of the men on the convoy stops your men hiding and reports it to his officer. The oofficer does nothing so when your 
men and you come out of hiding in a false sense of security the men from the transport truck ambush you... YOU DIE
3.4 You tell your men to hide a few alleys down and you alone, prepare explosives, set them, and then lay low in a broken-down car. As the convoy rolls over you detonate the bomb allong with the truck. You were very successful.

1.1...

1.2 You are faced with a difficult decision, you must do something to save your men, you can....
	1) Call men up 		2) Climb down		3) Hold	

1.3 You blew up the outpost And now sirens are going off in the distance, you see a sewer pipe large enough for someone to walk comfortably through and you and your men go in but there is a forked path, you can hear the sound of pursuers behind you. What will you do
	1) Left 		2)  Right		3) Fight

1.4  ***make this go to 1.2*** you are faced with a difficult decision, you must do something to save your men, you can
	1) Call men up		2) Climb down		3) Hold

3.1...

3.2 The convoy halts at the truck and 4 men walk out to try pushing the car out of the way. The driver steps out and starts to smoke. Your next decision is crucial, how should you start the engagement?.
	1) Stealth		2) Grenades		3) Weapons

3.3...

3.4 *** ***You are running wildly back to your men, who are waiting for you and you depart but there is alot of obstruction trying to travel off the main road, soon its become clear there is a group of men lurking around near by
 cause you can hear them but you have no idea where they are. By the sounds of it there could be up to 20 or more men and you know this could end things if you stumble across them un-prepared. When you come to an 
 alley with a left turn, right turn or a ladder you must make a decision beause it is not clear from which direction the noise is coming from.
 	1) Left 		2) Right 		3) Ladder

1.2.1 You call your men up and order them to equip long ranged weapons only, as a response unit drives past the building in search of you another truck is sent to the outpost to conduct an investigation. With one glance it is clear that the outpost is being occupied and rather than risk it a soldier from the truck
pulls out an RPG, you yell at your men to stop him but too late.. YOU DIE
1.2.2 You climb down and rejoin your men, the first thing you do is look to the city for safety and then an objective. You evade the response team sent to investigate the tower by finding a high up rooftop.
From the rooftop you can see a base camp for the muricans and talk to the men about how they can destroy it. You climb down from the roof when the heat goes away but you still need to find a way to get to the enemy base.
1.2.3 Everyone stays where they are and prepares to ambush the response team sent out by the muricans, Everyone lays low but it becomes clear that the men on the ground have no idea what to do with their commander on the tower so they are simply waiting.. the truck approaches.

1.3.1 You take the left tunnel which leads out into a large pond in the middle of town, there doesnt appear to be any enemy activity so you and your men step out and head for the nearest tall building to get some bearings and to make a plan of action.
1.3.2 You take the right tunnel and it leads to a waterfall the fall doesnt look inpossible but in the back of their minds they all realize this means they are going to be jumping into sewage run-off.
Epicly him and his men jump off the cliff as the muricans appraoch behind them and the moment when everyone is in the air is a truely heroic one untill you hit the water which turns out to be shallow, underneath is series of  bars arranged to filter the liquid through. You and your men crumple as each of you hit the "water"
as the last of your men hit the ground and shatters his body your journey ends... YOU DIE
1.3.3 You stand and fight, but the crampted tunnels and darkness is not a very ideal situation to be fighting in, as they approach your men have standing orders not to fire untill you can see the faces of the men you are to eliminate. The muricans were caught by surprise and you only lost one man in the engagment. Reinforcements are coming now,
by the sounds of it many more men are running down this hallway.

3.2.1 Yout attempt to stealthily eliminate the 5 men but it proves too much a few of your men were out of sync with eachother and 2 of them didn't die as all around them their comrades fell, with frantic shouting a dozen armed men hop out from the back and one goes up into the mounted gun
on the top of the truck, you and your men are slaughtered, a real bloodbath... YOU DIE.
3.2.2 The truck is very heavily armored and you are certain simply the action of grenades wont be enough but if everyone throws them under the truck perhaps that'll be adequate to destroy the truck. So as you yell "VOLLEY!" You and your men all lob grenades under the truck, the initial
reaction of the men trying to move the truck is to face the men jumping out of alleys and from behind various objects untill a resinating sound emminates from behind them and the force of the explosion lifts them off their feet.
But no sooner did the explosion go off you hear a screeching from tires nearby and the frantic honking of a large sounding vehicle.
3.2.3 2 snipers on a roof 1 with a light machine gun, and everyone one else with a grenade and an assault riffle.  The four men are almost done pushing the car out of the way when you order the attack, first two snipers go off the sound of the snipers still ringing in everyones ears as 2 bodies hit the ground, your light machine gunner jumps on top of the
broken down car and starts suurpressing fire on the retreating men, your soldiers take up defensive stations behind sturdy abojects or behind the corner of alleys and a firefight insues.
A dozen heavily armed men hop out of the back to join the 3 already fighting, despite the odds your snipers are doing a wonderful job of keeping one side surpressed and the light machine gunner the other side. But 15 outnumber your 7, The turning point of the fight is after you have slain 4 more of their men they get a sniper of their own who picks of one of your snipers followed
by a grenade that eliminates the other who wasn't paying attention due to the shock of his brothers blood on his face. With a devastating explostion is body is hurled over the edge and crumbles on the ground, men start pouring out of the left side of the truck while one goes back into the truck to secure a position in the mounte machine gun. Whatever good our light machinegunner was doing was shortly lived after his body was 
torn to pieces from the sheer force of huge 50.caliber rounds penetrating his body. Coming from both sides of the armored truck now you a monted machine gun on the top 2 of your men die anfter each killing 2 muricans and only you and Pvt.Danton are left. Danton is a newblood, not a single mark from battle on his helmet or his body, but  he is eager. One look in the ferocity of his eyes and they both know they will fight to the death.
Backed into a corner they both throw a grenade at the 4 men approaching down the alley, 2 of them die instantly and the other two are quickly slain. You leap out in time to see their commanding officer cooking a grenade, as he throws it you shoot him and the grende flies way up over you and your Private's head. The grenade explodes and tears down part of the building with it, crushing Private Danton.. With a battle cry you go into over drive and 
run at the mounted machine gunner and sniper, by some miracle you make it to the truck and throw another grenade inside of it and run away. The explotion of the truck tears every thought from your mind and lifts you high into the air, The entire convoy is death but so is Polar-force. As you get up you realise shrapnel is comming out of your stomach and all you want to do is go back to home base and sleep.

1.2.1...
1.2.2 You begin your journey towards the base camp but soon realize food is becoming a problem. You stop at a local food store but as the intell indicated each food store has guards and one "Goliath Guard" a very heavily armored light machine gunner with full bulletproff body armour. You have a few options, 
	1) Raid 		2) Sneak 		3) Diversion  		4) *Phillipes* Stealth Perk
1.2.3 You must decide what your order is going to be..
	1) Attack 		2) Hold 		3) Rouse	

1.3.1 Atop the building you see everything, including large amounts of fire indicating a large gathering of men or a base camp.
	1) Head For camp	2) Hold 		3) Light a beacon		
1.3.2...
1.3.3 The significantly larger group of reinforcements are inbound, 
	1) Left 		2) Right		3) Fight

3.2.1...
3.2.2 The unknown large vehicle is inbound but there are still a few muricans laying on the ground who are still alive,
	1) Flee			2) Finish the men 	3) Fight
3.2.3 Lathered in layers of blood both of your men and yourself you stumble for many hours trying to get back to your base camp, after much effort and exertion you finally make it. You are welcomed back but not before having your arm and your leg amputated. Its 20 years later and you have been dealing with Post-Traumantic Stress Dissorder
dissorder and have suffered every day since your men were lost, you have nightmares and can barely function with your dissability. All proves too much so on the anniversary of the slaughter you feel there is only on thing to do, you pull out the gun pressented at the ceremony of your honourable disscharge and put it in yout mouth... 
	1) Pull the trigger	2) Pull the trigger	3) Pull the trigger
