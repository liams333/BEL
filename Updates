PASTING FROM NOTEPAD DOCUMENT ON COMPUTER

Oct 17, 2014
~ We spent the first month or so working on our projects individually and realized we needed eachother to succeed.
  Today we started writing the story and added 2 characters to choose from..
  We don't know if we want to make our game using buttons or text format.

Oct 24, 2014
~ We made up our mind, we are going to use buttons and we found the JOptionPane we are going to use.
  We don't know how to add paths to our buttons but we will figure that out next day

~ Still haven't found a way to add path's the the JOptionPane so we might switch to making i textbase. 
  Although we made a main menu screen for our game!

Nov 7, 2014
~ We added a picture to the main menu and Mr.Jamieson helped us add a loop to the main menu.
  Saddly you cannot close the main menu screen with the X button cause the loop is holding it open.

Nov 14, 2014
~ Today we added 3 buttons to the main menu. Before we only had the one "Ok" button. 
  We now have a Play, How To Play and a Credits buttons
